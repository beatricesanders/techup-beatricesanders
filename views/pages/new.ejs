<h1> Create your own izzyQ ice-breaker! </h1>
<p>This is a card creator where you can add new questions to the izzyQ app, for other izzyQ users to enjoy!</p>
<p>The theme is fixed as "Pal Qs", to reflect these as questions added by Izzy's pals (that's you!), rather than Izzy herself.</p>
<p>Enter your question in the card below, then rate your question's "heat level". <a href = "about/#about-heat-tag-ref" target="_blank">What is a heat tag?</a></p>

<p>If your question is primarily based on fact, then it's heat level should be 1. </p>
<p>If your question involves forming a snap judgment, then it's heat level should be 2. </p>
<p>If your question involves forming a careful opinion, then it's heat level should be 3. </p>
